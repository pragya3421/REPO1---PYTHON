##---------------------##

# OOPs - Question

# Write a Python program to:

# Define a Student class with attributes name, grade, percentage, and team.

# Include an __init__ method to initialize these attributes.
# Add a method student_details that prints the studentâ€™s details in the format:
# "<name> is in <grade> grade with <percentage>%, from team <team>".
# Create two teams (team1 and team2) as string variables.

# Create at least two student objects, each belonging to one of the teams.

# Call the student_details method for each student to display their details.




                            ####OOPS FEATURES####

###4 features in OOPS which makes it more powerful. 
#Abstraction
#Encapsulation
#Inheritence
#Polymorphism



# ##ABSTRACTION - Hiding unnecessary details from users through method or class

# class Student:                              
#     def __init__(self, name, grade, percentage):        
#         self.name = name                   
#         self.grade = grade
#         self.percentage = percentage
     

#     def student_details(self):              #example of abstraction through method(hidden from users).   
#         print(f'{self.name} is in class {self.grade}, with {self.percentage+2}%')  


# #Object - Instance of class

# student1 = Student('Pragya', 11, 96)
# student2 = Student('Avinash', 12, 97)


# print(student1.percentage)
# student1.student_details()
# student2.student_details()


##ENCAPSULATION - Restrict access to certain attributes or methods to protect data and enforce controlled access.
#We use __ (double underscore) before attribute name after self. for encapsulation
#How to access attribute while encapsulated? - create new method to access, not directly.  

# class Student:                              
#     def __init__(self, name, grade, percentage):        
#         self.name = name                   
#         self.grade = grade
#         self.__percentage = percentage      ##double underscore limits access
     
#     def get_percentage(self):
#         return self.__percentage


#     def student_details(self):                
#         print(f'{self.name} is in class {self.grade}, with {self.percentage}%')  


# #Object - Instance of class

# student1 = Student('Pragya', 11, 96)
# student2 = Student('Avinash', 12, 97)


# # print(student1.percentage)      #error
# # print(student1.__percentage)    #error


# print(student1.get_percentage())




# ##INHERITANCE - Allows one class(child) to reuse the properties and methods of another class(parent). 

# ##PARENT CLAASS:
# class Student:                              
#     def __init__(self, name, grade, percentage):        
#         self.name = name                   
#         self.grade = grade
#         self.percentage = percentage     
     
#     def student_details(self):                
#         print(f'{self.name} is in class {self.grade}, with {self.percentage}%')  


# #Object - Instance of class

# student1 = Student('Pragya', 11, 96)
# student2 = Student('Avinash', 12, 97)

# ##CHILD CLASS:
# class GraduateStudent(Student):                #GraduateStudent child class inheriting the properties and methods from  Student parents class 
#     def __init__(self, name, grade, percentage, stream):    #old parametrs from parent class and new parameters in child class
#         super().__init__(name, grade, percentage)  #super is calling parent class init
#         self.stream = stream            #new attribute in child class

#     def student_details(self):
#         super().student_details()            #method inherit from parent class 
#         print(f'Stream is {self.stream}')
    

# #Object
# Grad_Student1 = GraduateStudent('Vibhuti', 12, 98, 'PCM') 
# #print(Grad_Student1.stream)


# Grad_Student1.student_details()




##POLYMORPHISM - Allows methods in different classes to have same name but different behavior depending on objects.

class Student:                              
    def __init__(self, name, grade, percentage):        
        self.name = name                   
        self.grade = grade
        self.percentage = percentage
     

    def student_details(self):                
        print(f'{self.name} is in class {self.grade}, with {self.percentage}%')  
        

#Object - Instance of class

student1 = Student('Pragya', 11, 96)
student2 = Student('Avinash', 12, 97)


##CHILD CLASS:

        self.stream = stream            

    def student_details(self):          #method
        # print(f'{self.name} is in class {self.grade}, with {self.percentage} and from stream {self.stream}')
        print('same method with different o/p')
